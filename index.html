          <h2>WHY THE WHEEL OF TIME</h2>
          <h1>An Epic Fantasy with Powerful Women</h1>
          <p>
            The Wheel of Time TV show brings Robert Jordan's epic fantasy to
            life with a rich world and a standout cast, especially its diverse
            and powerful female characters. From the enigmatic Moiraine to the
            fierce Nynaeve and ambitious Egwene, women drive the story in ways
            rarely seen in mainstream fantasy. The show gives them depth, flaws,
            and agency, making it a refreshing shift from traditional,
            male-dominated narratives.
            <br />
            <br />
            While it makes changes to the books, the adaptation skillfully
            navigates the challenge of condensing such a vast story.
            Streamlining plots and altering arcs were necessary to fit the
            medium while preserving the heart of Jordan's work. Though some
            changes may surprise longtime fans, they make the show more
            accessible and engaging, ensuring it stands strong as both an
            adaptation and a compelling fantasy series in its own right.

            <h1>Two Rivers</h1>
            <h2>Where was it shot?</h2>
            <p>
              Near the small village of Tetín, tucked into an old quarry, is the
              exterior set for the Two Rivers.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
              The Two Rivers is the heart of The Wheel of Time, a quiet,
              isolated village that becomes the starting point for the epic
              journey. Its humble origins contrast with the grand destiny of its
              characters, emphasizing themes of growth, fate, and the power of
              ordinary people to shape the world.

            <h1>Aiel Waste</h1>
            <h2>Where was it shot?</h2>
            <p>
              The production spent a significant amount of time filming in
              various locations around South Africa, for example the Atlantis
              Dunes.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
              The Aiel Waste is a harsh, unforgiving land that shapes the fierce
              and resilient Aiel people, setting them apart from the rest of the
              world. It plays a crucial role in the story's exploration of
              identity, prophecy, and cultural contrast, adding depth to the
              world and the characters tied to it.

            <h2>Where was it shot?</h2>
            <p>
              Jordan Studios can be found in Prague, which has multiple sound
              stages as well as production offices, and a backlot that houses
              the Tar Valon exterior set.

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
              Tar Valon is the political and magical center of the world, home
              to the powerful Aes Sedai and the iconic White Tower. As a symbol
              of knowledge, authority, and mystery, it anchors much of the
              story's intrigue and power struggles.

            Hi! My name is Lilla. I'm an aspiring front-end developer and a fan
            of The Wheel of Time. I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            React, and I've created some fun projects to practice my skills.

          <p>
            I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to
            develop my coding skills. The main focus was to practice using grids
            in vanilla CSS. The design was provided by SheCodes, and the goal
            was to recreate it as closely as possible.
